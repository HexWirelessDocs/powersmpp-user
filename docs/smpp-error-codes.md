!!! tip "How to use this reference"
    - When you see an error code in your **Campaign Reports**, **PDU Logs**, or **Event Viewer**, look it up in the tables above
    - **Standard SMPP codes** (0–255) are returned by the external SMSC/gateway
    - **iTextPro codes** (1024–1096) are generated internally by the Power SMPP platform
    - **HTTP GW codes** (110–1095) relate to HTTP gateway connectivity issues
    - Contact your administrator if you encounter persistent error codes
